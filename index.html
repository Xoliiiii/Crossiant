    <p>Croissants, those deliciously flaky pastries, have a unique history. They started in Austria as "kipferl," but it was
    the French who made them iconic. Marie Antoinette introduced them to France in the 18th century, and French bakers
    transformed them into the buttery, crescent-shaped treats we adore today. From there, croissants conquered the world,
    evolving into a variety of flavors and shapes. Nowadays, they're not just breakfast; they're a global pastry superstar!
